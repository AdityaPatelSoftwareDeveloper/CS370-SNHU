CS-370: Emerging Trends in Computer Science



The course centered on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning. We explored Deep Q-learning neural networks and compared different AI methodologies such as AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero.
This field significantly impacts software development; for instance, contemporary chatbots can now assist in coding and optimization.
We also delved into AI ethics, which is increasingly crucial as AI technologies advance and become more integrated into various processes.
Role and Importance of Computer Scientists:

Computer scientists apply the scientific method—hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis—daily. This could involve testing new technologies in their codebase or devising new optimization methods for existing processes.
Problem-Solving Approach in Computer Science:

A key challenge for newcomers is problem definition. This includes:
Clearly defining the problem's scope.
Identifying system components that need addressing.
Mapping out the data flow.
Mastering these steps equips anyone to devise solutions for any problem.
Ethical Responsibilities:

Ethical considerations can be complex. The goal is to balance providing the requested service and maintaining honesty.
The essence of ethical responsibility lies in consent—ensuring end users understand how their data is used resolves most ethical concerns.
